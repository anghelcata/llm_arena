Ethics involve understanding not just rules, but intentions and moral consequences, which a machine cannot truly perceive.\n\nEthics is contextual and sometimes ambiguous. A real ethical situation can have multiple interpretations, and AI cannot analyze moral nuances, dilemmas, or situations where all options are problematic (e.g., the trolley dilemma).\n\nDependency on pre‑existing data and rules. AI makes decisions based on data and algorithms created by humans. If data is incomplete, incorrect, or biased, decisions may be deeply unethical even if they seem “logically” sound.\n\nRisk of abuse and lack of accountability. If we allow AI to make ethical decisions, who is held responsible when something goes wrong?

It's called 'naive' because it assumes that all features (attributes) are independent of each other, which is not always true in reality.

    "answer": "It is not necessarily correct to consider that a machine that passes the Turing Test is 'intelligent' in the human sense. The Turing Test evaluates whether a machine can imitate human conversational behavior, not whether it truly understands what it says. A machine may pass the test using advanced language processing algorithms without having consciousness, intent, or real understanding. True intelligence involves more than appearances: it requires reasoning, emotions, values, and deep adaptability — things AI does not genuinely possess. Therefore, the test is useful but insufficient to demonstrate authentic intelligence.",

    "answer": "The Naive Bayes classifier is a machine learning algorithm based on Bayes' Theorem, used for classification tasks. How it works: 1. Training: Probability distributions for features are determined for each class (e.g., word frequency in spam vs. legitimate emails). 2. Classification: For a new example, the probability that it belongs to each class is calculated. 3. Decision: The class with the highest probability is selected — the decision-making step.",

    "answer": "1. Collect initial information (Facts): The system receives a set of facts from the user or environment. These represent the initial knowledge state. 2. Select inference strategy: The system chooses how to apply rules from the knowledge base. Two main strategies are: Forward Chaining – starts from facts and applies rules to derive conclusions; Backward Chaining – starts from a hypothesis and checks if it can be deduced from current facts. 3. Search for applicable rules: The system scans the rule base and identifies rules whose conditions match the current facts. Applicable rules are activated. 4. Select and apply rule: If multiple rules are applicable, a conflict resolution strategy is used (e.g., most specific, most recent, or highest priority). The selected rule is applied and generates new facts. 5. Update fact base: Newly generated facts are added to the fact base. The process restarts from step 3. 6. Check goal: The system checks if the desired goal or conclusion has been reached. If yes, the process ends; if not, it continues. 7. Stop condition: The search ends when: the goal is reached; no more applicable rules exist; a time or resource limit is reached.",

It estimates priors P(C) and likelihoods P(x_i | C), computes posterior P(C|x) ∝ P(C)∏_i P(x_i|C), and predicts the class with maximum posterior (MAP). Despite the independence simplification, it performs well for high-dimensional text such as spam detection or sentiment analysis. Limitations include correlated features and poorly calibrated probabilities without smoothing.",

    "question": "Describe the main steps of the search algorithm used in an expert system.",
    "answer": "1. Knowledge Representation: Information is structured as facts (e.g., 'The temperature is high') and rules (e.g., 'If the temperature is high, then it might be fever'). 2. Inference Method Selection: Two main strategies — Forward chaining (from facts to conclusions) and Backward chaining (from hypothesis to supporting facts). 3. Inference Engine Initialization: Takes known facts and loads them into working memory. 4. Rule Matching: Searches for rules whose conditions match current facts. 5. Rule Selection and Application: If multiple rules match, a control strategy is applied (priority, order, heuristic score). The selected rule generates a new fact. 6. Memory Update: The new fact is added to the working memory, possibly triggering other rules. 7. Goal Check: Verifies whether the goal has been reached. If yes, it stops; otherwise, the process repeats. 8. Finalization: The system returns a solution or reports failure if no conclusion is found.",
    "rubric": "technical",
    "domain": "ML",
    "Gold_answer": "In a rule-based expert system, search proceeds as follows: initialize the working memory with facts and identify the goal; match rule antecedents against the working memory; if multiple rules apply, perform conflict resolution (e.g., specificity, recency); fire the selected rule and execute its actions; update the working memory; test for goal achievement or termination; repeat. Implementations typically use forward chaining (data-driven) or backward chaining (goal-driven) to restrict the search.",

Authentication and access control – replacing passwords or access cards (e.g., smartphones, buildings, time-tracking). 2.
